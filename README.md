# Lantern Survey Analysis
I created graphs based on my collected student survey data to present to high school Chinese curriculum designers in Kansas City and Chicago. These graphs were also used to gauge student interest in Lantern, my podcast-based language learning platform.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib

I used the Pandas library to clean the data and Matplotlib to create these four graphs.

## Lessons Learned:

Choosing what information in the survey to display as a graphical representation heavily influences what curriculum designers focus on improving. Figure 1 used a short written survey question about what students were interested in learning about, and focusing on the number of student responses instead of percentages was appropriate due to the large number of keywords.
